# Soundly Sky Icons
<p>The Soundly Sky Icons were created for the Music Mixer project (IDP3 - Fanshawe College).<br> 
All of them have the sky as inspiration.<br>
The icon set was made using Adobe Illustrator.</p>

## Assignment Requirements

<p>"Use Terminal, Git and Github to create the project structure and a linked repository. Create a
minimum of 10 SVG icons in Illustrator - the theme is up to you.<br>
Use CSS to organize the icons on an HTML page with some branding and a (very) brief
description for each. You can choose how you want to implement this - as an image tag source,
as an SVG tag, or using the object tag.<br>
Use CSS interactions or transitions to change the icon’s appearance (on hover, as an example,
reverse all of the colours or add a drop shadow, etc).<br>
When clicked, toggle a “selected” CSS class on the active icon and log a message to the
console with the ID of the element that you’ve clicked. The ID should be retrieved and displayed
with a JavaScript string template and variable (refer to the class example)."</p>
